Among the rewards of this adventure has been the illumination of a number of fascinating parallels between this work and another amateur interest — the comparatively (and objectively) ancient study of insight meditation.</p><p name="f952" id="f952" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Having read a handful of essays on the topic of insight meditation, and practiced inconsistently and somewhat unskillfully for 4 or 5 years, I am still an early student of meditation. Likewise, I have only dipped my feet in the water of a particular, and deep, body of literature on modern generative-predictive cognition models. To save space I’ll shorten to PP the predictive processing model excellently treated by Dr. Andy Clark in Surfing Uncertainty, and HTM for the Hawkins/<a href="http://www.numenta.org" data-href="http://www.numenta.org" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Numenta</a> framework called Hierarchical Temporal Memory.</p><p name="7def" id="7def" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The mutual interest of Buddhist meditation and neuroscience isn’t new, which shouldn’t be surprising since both fields are deeply committed to an empirical exploration of the functioning of our brains and its role at the center of of human experience. Nor is there any lack of mutual awareness between these two spaces: a <a href="http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2003/07000/AlterationinBrain%20andImmuneFunctionProduced.14.aspx" data-href="http://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Abstract/2003/07000/AlterationinBrain%20andImmuneFunctionProduced.14.aspx" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">growing</a> <a href="http://journalpsyche.org/articles/0xc0b6.pdf" data-href="http://journalpsyche.org/articles/0xc0b6.pdf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">number</a> of <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/132/2/180/" data-href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/132/2/180/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">studies</a> have successfully measured neural and cognitive impacts of various types of meditation (both as therapy and independently), the difference between the minds of trained meditators vs. the lay person, etc. The quote at the top of this page is from one of many essays and talks by the current Dalai Lama, who is a long time student of neuroscience, and proponent of dialog between these disciplines.</p><p name="34de" id="34de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here, I simply want to share my own appreciation of several threads in some of the latest neuroscience literature, and what I think is an intriguing apparent consistency with the study (and experiences) of insight meditation. I hope a few of these points will be of practical interest to students of either field.</p><p name="72d2" id="72d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But first some (extremely) condensed background.</p><h4 name="013f" id="013f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Generative, predictive models of neocortex, extremely briefly</h4><p name="0031" id="0031" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">To me, the most compelling recent stories of neural function suggest that the thing our brains do (in particular, the neocortex, a 2mm thick, dinner napkin-sized sheet wrapping our brains), first and foremost, is probabilistic prediction. At any given point in time we hold in our brains, distributed across ~100 billion neurons, a model of our entire world, and we do this, above all else, to empower ourselves with the all-important ability to predict what’s about to happen (or more specifically, an array of possible events which may happen, weighted by how likely we deem them to be). And, or so is indicated by increasing neurobiological evidence, our brains employ a layered design mimicking that of the deeply structured and hierarchically organized world we live in.</p><p name="4989" id="4989" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Visual hierarchy is perhaps the easiest to conceive of — we notice that corners and color boundaries make up geometric shapes, which form features, which come together as animals, structures, motorcycles and avocados. But we see everything else as hierarchical too: pears are abstracted to fruits, which are abstracted to food.</p><p name="4573" id="4573" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When our brains predict, they are predicting at every level of this deep hierarchy from low level details to high level conceptions, and these predictions may span multiple kinds of sensory streams. The slew of predictions associated with a common daily action may include expectations of the specific internal muscular (proprioceptive) sensations of turning our wrist, to a precise guess at the level of resistance we’ll experience through the the flat metal object between our thumb and index finger, as well as the exact pitch and consistency of the sounds of revving and igniting of a 2003 Camry’s engine.</p><p name="8fb9" id="8fb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The HTM and PP frameworks agree that this prediction-focused process is driven by two constantly streaming, and opposing, information flows.</p><ol class="postList"><li name="9b58" id="9b58" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Upwards —</strong> Sensory information (the image data passed from our eyes to our visual cortex, or sounds picked up and passed to our XXX) flows up the hierarchy through different regions of the brain, each understanding and representing more complex and abstract aspects of our environment.</li><li name="1768" id="1768" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Downwards —</strong> Predictions based on associations with our current state and recent history — predictions that simultaneously encompass multiple lower level representations — are fed back down through the hierarchy, thus generating expected sensory inputs: what we believe we are most likely to see, feel, or hear next based on our best model of the present moment.</li></ol><p name="a472" id="a472" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">The PP theory includes an additional attribute not yet fully implemented in the HTM model, which is that upward-flowing sensory information, for the sake of efficiency, is encoded as ‘error’ signals representing deviations from our expectation. Said another way — as soon as a stable, well-evidenced top-down model for current perceptions has been recruited, the only incident sensory data we get are signals that disagree (are not predicted) by this model, and therefore indicating that we need to adjust it, or find a new model entirely.</p><h4 name="655e" id="655e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">The practice of insight meditation, extremely briefly</h4><p name="9e7f" id="9e7f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Insight meditation (which has had a recent re-popularizing as mindfulness meditation) is a ~2000 year old technique lying within a wide spectrum of Buddhist and non-Buddhist traditions. The goal of the practice is to hone an ability to focus on the details of present experience and to observe every phenomenon that arises.</p><p name="e063" id="e063" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is both orders of magnitude more difficult than it sounds, for those who haven’t tried it seriously, and surprisingly rewarding, and I suspect neuroscience will continue to uncover (and reinterpret) a list of theories helping to explain why.</p><p name="d4eb" id="d4eb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the key challenges to this kind of meditation is training your brain to focus on sensory experience alone, independent from the context-dependent, judgmental/normative response that, as humans, we tightly pair it with. The goal is to turn down the knob on higher order analyses, associations, pattern recognition and prediction — the very things our brains evolved to do. To do this, one has to notice each of these experiences as internal states, as phenomena of their own, rather than responding to them directly. If successful, one can experience the continuing flow of sensory stimulation without distraction from analytical threads or mental ‘time travel’ such as memories of the past or plans for the future.</p><p name="c5c7" id="c5c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">To finally get to the point, let’s consider what meditation asks our brains to do, in the context of the predictive generative model, and see why it’s so difficult.</p></div></div></section><section name="62b9" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="48ec" id="48ec" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">On a quiet evening, I sit down on the rug in my room and close my eyes. I take a breath, and train my focus on the pure physical experience, that is, the raw sensory feeling of air passing through my nose and into my lungs.</p><h4 name="4fac" id="4fac" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Attention</h4><p name="3d80" id="3d80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There are many theories of attention, and it is still poorly understood, however, the PP model theorizes that it may emerge from the brain’s ability to dynamically control the level of precision attributed to specific populations of upward streaming input. By increasing the precision weighting of unpredicted ‘errors’ from sensory inputs (and therefore relatively decreasing the influence of prior top-down predictions), our perception may be influenced towards a sensory-based, rather than prediction-based experience: an observation of the sensations of air flowing into our lungs, as opposed to the simple acknowledgment that we are inhaling.</p><p name="5a62" id="5a62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Breathing is primarily an involuntary behavior. In the absence of attention, and in the majority of daily experience, a higher level awareness of one’s own breathing is essentially non-existent. The PP model might lead us to believe that sensations associated with breathing are so deeply associated and predictable (humans experience millions of breaths by the time we reach conscious maturity), that prediction errors rarely make it to higher brain regions where they might become actively ‘conscious’. The act of attending closely to the sensation of breathing, therefore, is extremely novel. The nuances we learn to notice which differentiate one breath from the next may be examples of tiny error signals (imperfectly predicted features) which only make it into our awareness due to this aggressive precision-weighting based amplification. The upshot of this assessment may then be that meditation enables us to observe aspects of reality that are truly unavailable in any other less attentive context.</p><p name="e3f6" id="e3f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back in my room, sitting on my rug, I begin to take a second breath. I attend to the internal sensation of my lungs beginning to expand, and then suddenly, through a process that feels completely out of my control, I am thinking about a blue rubber kickball, recess, and the playground of the kindergarten I attended decades ago.</p><h4 name="334b" id="334b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Association</h4><p name="8f1b" id="8f1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Tracing back, as meditation teaches, in order to understand the path by which my focus was undermined, I realize that my rug reminds me of the mats we used to flop down on the kindergarten classroom floor and sit on during story time.</p><p name="ade6" id="ade6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The intense associative nature of memory is one of the easiest dynamics to observe, because we are experiencing it constantly. HTM demonstrates the way a simple algorithm of association between ‘spatial’ patterns of neurons or neural columns is able to learn robust relationships within incoming streams of information. This model employs Hebbian learning, which posits that neural plasticity resulting in learning and memory is achieved by strengthening the connections between neurons that often activate simultaneously — “fire together, wire together”.</p><p name="632a" id="632a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sensory experience of the threads of the carpet, and the rare (in adulthood) feeling of sitting on the floor, are bottom up inputs that are strongly associated not only with me trying to learn how to meditate, but also, still (apparently), neural circuits forged when I was five while ignoring story time and strategizing in preparation for recess.</p><h4 name="455e" id="455e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Impermanence &amp; Dissatisfaction</h4><p name="4745" id="4745" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">As soon as we are successful at dialing down our associative and predictive habits, our quiet, dark room begins to feel a lot less quiet.</p><p name="0e1f" id="0e1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We notice and amplify changes, aspects of the flow of incoming sensory information that don’t exactly fit our current model. The unexpected chirping of a bird outside the window is almost startling. Changes are crucial to our brains because they indicate that our current model for ‘how things are’ may no longer be valid, and we may need to take some different action to say, stay warm, find food, or narrowly avoid a rain-filled pothole. We are so eager to identify changes to the status quo that our brains are constantly looking for deviations from the present prediction. Even minor signals may at least transiently get amplified as needing our attention. The predictive mechanics are constantly striving to find or adapt models that “explain away” the current sensory input such that each new moment (and all the generated sensory experiences associated with it) is expected.</p><p name="28e8" id="28e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If we found ourselves in such a pure and enduring state (maybe what artists and software engineers call ‘flow’), we could choose the ideal action (or inaction) at each moment and thus preserve a fully predictable world around us, one without threats or risk of the unknown. But meditation teaches us this isn’t possible, at least not to sustain.</p><p name="5467" id="5467" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In my quiet dark room, there is no perfect calm, my internal state is constantly changing—my body is processing food, my hair is growing, and my brain is working especially hard (given the apparent lack of relevant sensory input) to find models to help understand my environment, and ultimately predict the future so I can most effectively act within it.</p><h4 name="ce3d" id="ce3d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Extrapolation &amp; Generation</h4><p name="b866" id="b866" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">We note that during normal daily life our brains are constantly, and naturally associating and extrapolating — “there’s the fuzzy brown foot of a dog, I’m probably seeing a dog”. These association prompt a torrent of probability-weighted predictions of the type described earlier: “If I look up and to the right, I’m pretty sure I’ll see some floppy ears and a wet nose”.</p><p name="0726" id="0726" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This extrapolation is tightly linked with the dynamics of association, but in our perceptual experience it may be more easily seen as a ‘filling in the gaps’.</p><p name="a7c2" id="a7c2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When concentration is broken once again by the sound of a noisy two-cylinder engine that appears to get louder before fading away, an expert meditator might maintain their focus and experience the incident sounds purely, without higher level conception. But as an amateur, the opportunity for my brain to spin up a new predictive model is exploited instantly. My experience of the sound is not that of a loud, oscillating noise, or even as something produced by an engine. A model is recruited via association which accounts for how close my window is to the street, the time of day, and the knowledge of my neighborhood. This model most effectively minimizes the onset of this new unexpected signal, and translates directly into my perception. And my perception, importantly, is not the incident sound, it is the motorbike itself, topped with a rider, burning gas as it ascends the hill outside my window, and then eventually disappears around the corner. The new predictive model in my brain generates these sensory expectations, which I experience as something like a low-detail film of the (extrapolated and predicted) events outside, all while my eyes are closed.</p><p name="dc36" id="dc36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This last example alludes to theories of how this generative model may explain activities such as conceptualizing, planning, and even dreaming. See Surfing Uncertainty for a thorough treatment of these.</p><p name="ffd0" id="ffd0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">I have remained intrigued by meditation precisely because the challenges presented above (if the theories referenced here are on track) seem to richly illustrate real dynamics inherent to human cognition — its incredible capacity, as well as its limits and vulnerabilities.</p></div></div></section><section name="b2c0" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 name="60e9" id="60e9" class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading">More reading on these topics</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="1d55" id="1d55" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27539.On_Intelligence?ac=1&amp;from_search=true" data-href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27539.On_Intelligence?ac=1&amp;from_search=true" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" target="_blank">On Intelligence</a> by Jeff Hawkins</li><li name="3da9" id="3da9" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25823558-surfing-uncertainty" data-href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25823558-surfing-uncertainty" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" target="_blank">Surfing Uncertainty</a> by Andy Clark</li><li name="d735" id="d735" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li graf--last"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22329411-waking-dreaming-being" data-href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22329411-waking-dreaming-being" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" target="_blank">Waking, Dreaming, Being: Self and Consciousness in Neuroscience, Meditation, and Philosophy</a> by Evan Thompson</li></ul></div></div></section>
